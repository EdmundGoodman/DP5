# DP5

## What is DP5?

DP5 as described in our [latest paper](https://doi.org/10.1039/D1SC04406K) calculates the standalone
probability of structures being correct. If a user cannot guarantee the correct structure is in the list of proposals,
DP5 calculates the probability each is correct, quantifying this uncertainty.

[DP5](https://doi.org/10.1039/D1SC04406K) integrates NMR-AI, software for automatic processing, assignment
and visualisation of raw NMR data. This functionality affords fully automated DP4 analysis of databases of molecules
with no user input. DP5 also utilises a fully revised version of PyDP4 updated for Python 3 and with major workflow
improvements.

Users can now also choose to run DP5 within a Graphical user interface for increased ease of use when single DP4
calculations. This graphical user interface can also be used to explore the spectra processed and assigned by NMR-AI.
DP5 can also be utilised to perform assignments of NMR spectra for a single isomer of a molecule. These assignments
can be viewed in the graphical output from DP5 or investigated interactively using The included GUI application.

More details about the software can be found in the publication
[DP5 Straight from Spectrometer to Structure](https://doi.org/10.1039/D1SC04406K) and in the accompanying
supporting information.
